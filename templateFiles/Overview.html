  <h1> Is The SAT A Genuine Indicator Of College Success? </h1>
  <div class="correlationquestions">
  <h2>1. How did the correlation between SAT scores and College Completion Rates vary across the years?</h2>
  <p> <b>Objective</b>: To generate this visualization, at each recorded year, we computed the correlation between the SAT scores and the College Completion Rates between all states in that year. 
    We then generated a line graph that seeks to visualize the trend in the correlation scores - is the correlation getting stronger? weaker? staying about the same? By visualizing this trend,
    we are likely to gain insights into the possibility of the SAT either improving or declining as a performance metric in indicating college success.</p>

  <h2>2. How did the correlation between SAT scores and College Completion Rates vary across different states?</h2>
  <p> <b>Objective</b>: To generate this visualization, for each of the 50 states, we computed the correlation between the SAT scores and the College Completion Rates across all recorded years. 
    We then generated a scatter plot that seeks to visualize the possibility of outliers - are the most affluent and populous states contributing disproportionately into indicating that the SAT is a 
    genuine indicator? What states seem to show negative correlation and why does the SAT not prove effective for such states? </p>
