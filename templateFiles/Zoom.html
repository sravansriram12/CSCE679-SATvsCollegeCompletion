  <h1> What Could Explain The Correlation Trends? </h1>

  <h2>1. How did the Mean SAT scores vary across the years?</h2>
  <p> <b>Objective</b>: To generate this visualization, at each recorded year, we computed a multiple box plot of the Mean SAT scores of all states in that year. 
    We seek to visualize the movement of certain statistics pertaining to the Mean SAT scores for all states - the median, quartiles, and outliers.
    we are likely to gain insights into how the variation in Mean SAT scores across years have affected the overall view of the correlation scores.</p>
